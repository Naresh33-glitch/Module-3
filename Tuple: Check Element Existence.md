# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```python
tuplex = ("S", 89, "R", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e","D")
print('r'in tuplex)
print('5'in tuplex)
```

## Result
The program successfully checks for the existence of both the character 'n' and the number 8 in the given tuple and prints True for each, confirming their presence.
